Ethical Principles of the Nomenclature of Human Diseases
========================================================
Since the present naming protocols could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts.  To mitigate such impacts, we introduce the ethical principles for the latest naming protocols of human diseases.  Relatedly, we orchestrate rich metadata available to unveil the nosological evolution of anachronistic names and demonstrate the heuristic approaches to curate exclusive substitutes for inopportune nosology based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations.
