Ethical Principles of the Nomenclature of Human Diseases
========================================================
Since the present naming protocols could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts.  To mitigate such impacts, we introduce the ethical principles for the latest naming protocols of human diseases.  Relatedly, we orchestrate rich metadata available to unveil the nosological evolution of anachronistic names and demonstrate the heuristic approaches to curate exclusive substitutes for inopportune nosology based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations.

In the global online news coverage experiments, we aim to unveil the scientific paradigms of the diachronic discourse and emotional tone. Here, the metadata analysis aims to demonstrate the emotional polarity of the public in the context of global online news on German measles, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu and Huntington's disease over time, respectively.
